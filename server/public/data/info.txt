If you delete this file, the terminal will throw error:

```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/Users/B1-66-ER/Desktop/Prime/Prime GitHub/Week 4/express_node_sql_code_challenge/server/public/data'
    at Error (native)
```

I didn't discover why this folder is necessary given the code. But adding the folder stoped the terminal error message.
